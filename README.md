# Interfaces
- Interface can have only abstract methods. Since Java 8, it can have default and static methods also
- Interface supports multiple inheritance.
- Interface has only static and final variables.
- Interface can't provide the implementation of abstract class
- The interface keyword is used to declare interface.
- An interface can extend another Java interface only.
- An interface can be implemented using keyword implements
- Members of a Java interface are public by default.
# Abstract classes
- Abstract class can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
- Abstract class doesn't support multiple inheritance.
- Abstract class can have final, non-final, static and non-static variables.
- Abstract class can provide the implementation of interface.
- The abstract keyword is used to declare abstract class.
- An abstract class can be extended using keyword "extends".
- A Java abstract class can have class members like private, protected, etc
# Polymorphism
- The word polymorphism means having many forms
- polymorphism is considered as one of the important features of Object Oriented Programming.
- polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form.
## Method signature
- The method signature consists of the method name and the parameter list.
- It's the combination of the method name and the parameter list.
- public void setMapReference(Point position)
 {
 //method code
 }
 ## Method Overloading
 - When there are multiple functions with same name but different parameters then these functions are said to be overloaded
 - Functions can be overloaded by change in number of arguments or/and change in type of arguments.
